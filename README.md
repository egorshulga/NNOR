# NNOR
Printed Text Optical Recognition.

C++ with OpenCV (http://opencv.org/)

OCR processing can be divided into 2 phases: image preprocessing and recognition

Preprocessing main purpose is to segment input text into a list of separate characters.
This is done through binarization and profiles (vertical and horyzontal projections) processing.

Recognition is still to be implemented.
It will be based on artificial neural network concepts.
